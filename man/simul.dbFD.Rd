\title{Simulations to Explore Relationships Between Functional Diversity Indices}
\description{
\code{simul.dbFD} generates artificial communities of species with artificial functional traits. Different functional diversity (FD) indices are computed from these communities using \code{\link{dbFD}} to explore their inter-relationships.
}
\usage{
simul.dbFD(s = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40), t = 3, 
          r = 10, p = 100, tr.method = c("unif", "norm", "lnorm"),
          abun.method = c("lnorm", "norm", "unif"), w.abun = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{s}{vector listing the different levels of species richness used in the simulations}
  \item{t}{number of traits}
  \item{r}{number of replicates per species richness level}
  \item{p}{number of species in the common species pool}
  \item{tr.method}{character string indicating the sampling distribution for the traits. \code{"unif"} is a uniform distribution, \code{"norm"} is a normal distribution, and \code{"lnorm"} is a lognormal distribution.}
  \item{abun.method}{character string indicating the sampling distribution for the species abundances. Same as for \code{tr.method}.}
  \item{w.abun}{logical; should FDis, FEve, FDiv, and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q) be weighted by species abundances?}
}
\value{
A list contaning the following elements:

  \item{results}{data frame containing the results of the simulations}
  \item{traits}{matrix containing the traits}
  \item{abun}{matrix containing the abundances}
  \item{abun.gamma}{species abundances from the pooled set of communities}
  \item{FDis.gamma}{FDis of the pooled set of communities}
  \item{FDis.mean}{mean FDis from all communities}
\code{FDis.gamma} and \code{FDis.mean} can be used to explore the set concavity criterion (Ricotta 2005) for FDis.

A graph plotting the results of the simulations is also returned.
