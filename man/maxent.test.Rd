Inferential Permutation Tests for Maximum Entropy Models
}
\description{
\code{maxent.test} performs the permutation tests proposed by Shipley (2010) for maximum entropy models.
Two different null hypotheses can be tested:
1) the information encoded in the \emph{entire set} of constraints \eqn{\mathbf{C}}{C} is irrelevant for predicting the probabilities, and
2) the information encoded in \emph{subset} \eqn{\mathbf{B}}{B} of the entire set of constraints \eqn{\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{A}\cup{}\mathbf{B}}{C = {A U B}} is irrelevant for predicting the probabilities.
A plot can be returned to facilitate interpretation.
}

\usage{
maxent.test(model, obs, sub.c, nperm = 99, quick = TRUE,
alpha = 0.05, plot = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{model}{
list returned by \code{\link{maxent}}.
}
  \item{obs}{
vector, matrix or data frame of observed probabilities of the states (columns).
}
  \item{sub.c}{
character or numeric vector specifying the subset of constraints \eqn{\mathbf{B}}{B} associated with null hypothesis 2.
If missing, null hypothesis 1 is tested.
}
  \item{nperm}{
number of permutations for the test.
}
  \item{quick}{
if \code{TRUE}, the algorithm stops when \code{alpha} is outside the confidence interval of the \emph{P}-value.
Can be useful to speed up the routine.
}

  \item{alpha}{
desired alpha-level for the test. Only relevant if \code{quick} is \code{TRUE}.
}

  \item{plot}{
if \code{TRUE}, a plot is returned to facilitate interpretation.
}

\details{
\code{maxent.test} is a direct translation of the permutation tests described by Shipley (2010). Please refer to this article for details.

Using \code{quick = FALSE} will return the true null probability for a given \code{nperm}. However, if \code{nperm} is large (a rule-of-thumb is \eqn{>=999}{>=999} permutations for allowing inference at \eqn{\alpha}{alpha} = 0.05), this can take a very long time. Using \code{quick = TRUE} is a much faster and highly recommended alternative if one is only interested in accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis at the specified \eqn{\alpha}{alpha}-level given by argument \code{alpha}.

If \code{\link{maxent}} was run with multiple data sets (i.e. if \code{constr} had more than one row), then  \code{maxent.test} performs the test for all sets simultaneously, following the \sQuote{omnibus} procedure described by Shipley (2010).

The following measure of fit between observed and predicted probabilities is returned:

\deqn{\mathrm{fit}=1-\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{D} \sum_{i=1}^{S}\left(o_{ij}-p_{ij}\right)^{2}}}{\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{D} \sum_{i=1}^{S}\left(o_{ij}-q_{ij}\right)^{2}}}{%
fit = 1 - (sum(o_ij - p_ij)^2 / sum(o_ij - q_ij)^2)}

where \eqn{o_{ij}}{o_ij}, \eqn{p_{ij}}{o_ij}, and \eqn{q_{ij}}{q_ij} are the observed, predicted
and prior probabilities of state \eqn{i}{i} from data set \eqn{j}{j}, respectively, \eqn{S}{S} is
the number of states, and \eqn{D}{D} the number of data sets (i.e. rows in \code{obs}). A value of 1 indicates perfect predictive capacity, while a value near zero
indicates that the constraints provide no additional information beyond what is already contained in the
prior \eqn{\mathbf{q}}{q} (Sonnier et al. 2009).

beyond that already provided by the prior distribution.

  \item{r2.q}{Pearson \eqn{r^2}{r^2} between observed and prior probabilities;

  \item{obs.stat}{observed statistic used for the permutation test; see Shipley (2010)}

\section{Warning}{\code{maxent.test} is a computationally intensive function. The tests can take a very long time when \code{nperm} is large and \code{quick = FALSE}. It is highly recommended to use \code{quick = TRUE} because of this, unless you are interested in obtaining the true null probability.} 

\seealso{
\code{\link{maxent}} to run the maximum entropy model that is required by \code{maxent.test}.

Another faster version of \code{maxent.test} for multicore processors called \code{maxent.testMC} is available from Etienne \enc{Laliberté}{Laliberte} (\email{etiennelaliberte@gmail.com}). It's exactly the same as \code{maxent.test} but makes use of the \pkg{multicore}, \pkg{doMC}, and \pkg{foreach} packages. Because of this, \code{maxentMC} only works on POSIX-compliant OS's (essentially anything but Windows).

# example with tussock dataset
traits <- tussock$trait[, c(2:7, 11)] # use only continuous traits
traits <- na.omit(traits) # remove 2 species with NA's

# do the constraints give predictive ability?
maxent.test(pred.abun, obs = abun[1,], nperm = 49)
