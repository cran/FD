Estimating Probabilities via Maximum Entropy: Improved Iterative Scaling
}
\description{
\code{maxent} returns the probabilities that maximize the entropy conditional on a series of constraints that are linear in the features. It relies on the Improved Iterative Scaling algorithm of Della Pietra et al. (1997). It has been used to predict the relative abundances of a set of species given the trait values of each species and the community-aggregated trait values at a site (Shipley et al. 2006; Shipley 2009; Sonnier et al. 2009).

\details{
The biological model of community assembly through trait-based habitat
filtering (Keddy 1992) has been translated mathematically
via a maximum entropy (maxent) model by Shipley et al. (2006) and
Shipley (2009). A maxent model contains three components: (i) a set
of possible states and their attributes, (ii) a set of macroscopic empirical constraints,
and (iii) a prior probability distribution \eqn{\mathbf{q}=[q_j]}{q = [qj]}.

In the context of community assembly, states are species, macroscopic
empirical constraints are community-aggregated traits, and prior probabilities
\eqn{\mathbf{q}}{q} are the relative abundances of species of the regional
pool (Shipley et al. 2006, Shipley 2009). By default, these prior
probabilities \eqn{\mathbf{q}}{q} are maximally uninformative (i.e. a uniform distribution),
but can be specificied otherwise (Shipley 2009, Sonnier et al. 2009).

To facilitate the link between the biological model and the mathematical
model, in the following description of the algorithm states are species and constraints are traits.

Note that if \code{constr} is a matrix or data frame containing several sets (rows),
a maxent model is run on each individual set. In this case if \code{prior} is a vector,
the same prior is used for each set. A different prior can also be specified for each set.
In this case, the number of rows in \code{prior} must be equal to the number of rows in \code{constr}. 

If \eqn{\mathbf{q}}{q} is not specified, set \eqn{p_{j}=1/S}{pj = 1 / S} for each of the
\eqn{S}{S} species (i.e. a uniform distribution), where \eqn{p_{j}}{pj} is the
probability of species \eqn{j}{j}, otherwise \eqn{p_{j}=q_{j}}{pj = qj}.

Calulate a vector \eqn{\mathbf{c=\left[\mathrm{\mathit{c_{i}}}\right]}=\{c_{1},\; c_{2},\;\ldots,\; c_{T}\}}{c = [ci] = {c1, c2, ..., cT}},
where \eqn{c_{i}={\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{S}t_{ij}}}{ci = sum(tij)}; i.e. each \eqn{c_{i}}{ci}
is the sum of the values of trait \eqn{i}{i} over all species, and \eqn{T}{T}
is the number of traits.

Repeat for each iteration \eqn{k}{k} until convergence:

1. For each trait \eqn{t_{i}}{ti} (i.e. row of the constraint matrix) calculate:

\deqn{
\gamma_{i}(k)=ln\left(\frac{\bar{t}_{i}}{{\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{S}\left(p_{j}(k)\; t_{ij}\right)}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{c_{i}}\right)}{%
gamma_i(k) = ln(t.mean_i / [sum(pj(k) tij)]) (1 / ci)}

This is simply the natural log of the known community-aggregated
trait value to the calculated community-aggregated trait value at
this step in the iteration, given the current values of the probabilities.
The whole thing is divided by the sum of the known values of the trait
over all species.

2. Calculate the normalization term \eqn{Z}{Z}:

\deqn{Z(k)=\left({\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{S}p_{j}(k)\; e^{\left({\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{T}\gamma_{i}(k)}\; t_{ij}\right)}}\right)}{%
Z(k) = sum(pj(k) e^(gamma_i(k) tij) ) }

3. Calculate the new probabilities \eqn{p_{j}}{pj} of each species at iteration \eqn{k+1}{k+1}:

\deqn{p_{j}(k+1)=\frac{{\displaystyle p_{j}(k)\; e^{\left({\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{T}\gamma_{i}(k)}\; t_{ij}\right)}}}{Z(k)}}{%
pj(k+1) = [pj(k) e^(gamma_i(k) tij)/ Z]}

4. If \eqn{|max\left(p\left(k+1\right)-p\left(k\right)\right)|\leq}{|max(pj(k+1) - pj(k))| <=} tolerance threshold (i.e. argument \code{tol}) then stop, else repeat steps 1 to 3.

When convergence is achieved then the resulting probabilities (\eqn{\hat{p}_{j}}{pj_hat})
are those that are as close as possible to \eqn{q_j}{qj} while simultaneously maximize
the entropy conditional on the community-aggregated traits. The solution to this problem is
the Gibbs distribution:

\deqn{\hat{p}_{j}=\frac{q_{j}e^{\left({\displaystyle -}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{T}\lambda_{i}t_{ij}}\right)}}{{\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{S}q_{j}}e^{\left({\displaystyle -}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{T}\lambda_{i}t_{ij}}\right)}}=\frac{q_{j}e^{\left({\displaystyle -}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{T}\lambda_{i}t_{ij}}\right)}}{Z}}{%
Note: equation not shown in HTML help file: please refer to PDF manual.}

This means that one can solve for the Langrange multipliers (i.e.
weights on the traits, \eqn{\lambda_{i}}{lamda_i}) by solving the linear system
of equations:

\deqn{\left(\begin{array}{c}
ln\left(\hat{p}_{1}\right)\\
ln\left(\hat{p}_{2}\right)\\
\vdots\\
ln\left(\hat{p}_{S}\right)\end{array}\right)=\left(\lambda_{1},\;\lambda_{2},\;\ldots,\;\lambda_{T}\right)\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
t_{11} & t_{12} & \ldots & t_{1S}-ln(Z)\\
t_{21} & t_{22} & \vdots & t_{2S}-ln(Z)\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
t_{T1} & t_{T2} & \ldots & t_{TS}-ln(Z)\end{array}\right]-ln(Z)}{%
Note: equation not shown in HTML help file: please refer to PDF manual.}

This system of linear equations has \eqn{T+1}{T+1} unknowns (the \eqn{T}{T} values
of \eqn{\lambda}{lambda} plus \eqn{ln(Z)}{ln(Z)}) and \eqn{S}{S} equations. So long as the number
of traits is less than \eqn{S-1}{S-1}, this system is soluble. In fact, the
solution is the well-known least squares regression: simply regress
the values \eqn{ln(\hat{p}_{j})}{ln(pj_hat} of each species on the trait values
of each species in a multiple regression.

The intercept is the value of \eqn{ln(Z)}{ln(Z)} and the slopes are the values
of \eqn{\lambda_{i}}{lambda_i} and these slopes (Lagrange multipliers) measure
by how much the \eqn{ln(\hat{p}_{j})}{ln(pj_hat)}, i.e. the \eqn{ln}{ln}(relative abundances),
changes as the value of the trait changes.

\code{\link{maxent.test}} provides permutation tests for maxent models (Shipley 2010).

Another faster version of \code{maxent} for multicore processors called \code{maxentMC} is available from Etienne \enc{Laliberté}{Laliberte} (\email{etiennelaliberte@gmail.com}). It's exactly the same as \code{maxent} but makes use of the \pkg{multicore}, \pkg{doMC}, and \pkg{foreach} packages. Because of this, \code{maxentMC} only works on POSIX-compliant OS's (essentially anything but Windows).
